here is a clone of netflix and my learning journey through this.
it has three major walk-arounds 
    1.HTML(developed the UI basic structure)
    2.CSS (gave the styling to the HTML document to beautify the website or say webpage)
    3.JAVASCRIPT: accessed the data from tmdb (api),through event listeners and dom(document object model) and structured or aligned it with the website.
